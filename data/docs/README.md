# Node School Vancouver

This is our static site generator, powered by [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)

## Attendees

Want a simple pull request? Add yourself to the data/attendees/ directory. Create a new yaml file with your name, with the following content:

```
---
name: Name
github: <github id>
twitter: <optional twitter id>
```

When in doubt, look at other people in that directory

## Mentors

If you want to help teach or contribute in anyway, Add yourself to the data/mentors/ directory. Create a new yaml file with your name, with the following content:

```
---
name: Name
github: <github id>
twitter: <optional twitter id>
```

We usually like mentors to have come to a session before, and read up on the https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers/wiki/Event-Mentor-Best-Practices#on-being-a-mentor section on the nodeschool wiki.

# Old README

# NodeSchool Vancouver üá®üá¶

NodeSchool is a series of open source [workshoppers](http://nodeschool.io/) that
teach web software skills.

NodeSchool meetups like NodeSchoolYVR provide a space for people to do the
workshoppers on their own or with others. The workshopper tutorials are used as
the course curriculum, while mentors are here to help attendees work through
challenges. Learn more [here](http://nodeschool.io/vancouver/).

## Join our meetups üíª

RSVP to our scheduled events on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/nodeschool-vancouver).
Feel free to come 15 minutes early and help set up!

If you're a sponsor and want to host workshops for new and experienced devs,

Workshops from before Nov 2017 are archived [here](https://ti.to/nodeschool-vancouver).
