# Sponsorship Package

## Types of sponsorship
You or your organization can be either a _cash_ or a _venue_ sponsor.

You can go either month-to-month or be a **12-month Exclusive Sponsor**.

The **12-month Exclusive Sponsor** option is only available if all other sponsorships for your chosen type of sponsorshop (that is, either _cash_ or _venue_) at the time are "Month-to-month". In the event that an Exclusive Sponsor is secured, NodeSchoolYVR will not entertain any other sponsorship agreements of that type for the duration of the 12-month term.
